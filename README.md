## Pre-Requisites 
This script requires MySQL 8.0 or higher to be installed. Last tested on MySQL 8.0.  
This script databases and text log files in the same directory.

## Introduction
This is a simple banking management system which can be used to create, manipulate or delete client information stored in the Bank’s Database. Upon startup, the user is asked basic questions on whether the device on which they are using the code has MySQL installed or not? They are also asked the root password for the Server. This is mandatory information which the user must enter to use the system properly. In real life, banks may have these details pre-loaded on starting the program. But this system is designed to be universal and used on any system, hence the questions are asked.  
  
The user is then presented with the main console where they can start using the database and create or manipulate client information. In case the user doesn’t know how to use the system or is starting for the first time, they can use /help and the system will help them to get started off, hence it is designed to be user friendly and easy to use.
Furthermore, this system also contains admin mode which gives instant administrative privileges and full control of the database.

## Usage
An administrator can view information of all clients, delete funds or entire records when in admin mode.
The user whilst in Client Interface can use the following commands.  
  
/register  
/login  
/logout  
/deposit  
/withdraw  
/transfer  
/balance  
/stat  
/change pin  
/change username  
/cancel acc  
/enteradmin  
/godmode  
/help  
/feedback  
/about  
/quit  
  
The system also offers survey forms if the user wants to give feedback about it.  
Other features include, PIN protected accounts, Case or Number criteria checks, Penalty wait time or Automatic Logouts in case of repeated incorrect verification, waiting time for transactions, etc.  
The system is tested and tries to print custom messages in case of unexpected errors during runtime or exceptions rather than terminating unexpectedly.
